# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository presents a collection of foundational and applied machine learning mini-projects built as part of a formal coursework submission. Each project demonstrates core concepts of classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and kernel methods using real datasets and theoretical understanding.

## üìÅ Project Overview

### 1. **Instance-Based, Tree-Based, and Probabilistic Classifiers**
**Folder:** `knn-dt-nb-models`  
Explore and compare three fundamental supervised learning algorithms:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**

Each model is evaluated using decision boundaries, classification metrics, and comparative performance plots.

**Files Included:**
- `knn-dt-nb-models.ipynb`: Source notebook implementing and evaluating all three models.
- `knn-dt-nb-models.pdf`: PDF export of the notebook.
- `FOML_ASSIGNMENT1.pdf`: Problem statement and instructions.

### 2. **Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression**
**Folder:** `logistic-kaggle-regression`  
A binary classification problem based on structured data resembling a Kaggle challenge setup.

- Applied preprocessing and feature engineering
- Built logistic regression model from scratch and using `scikit-learn`
- Generated predictions and a sample submission

**Files Included:**
- `FOML_ASSIGN_3_CS24MTECH14011.ipynb`: Full pipeline from preprocessing to prediction.
- `loan_train.csv`, `loan_test.csv`: Training and test datasets.
- `FOML_ASSIGNMENT_3.pdf`: Problem description.

### 3. **Theory, Dimensionality Reduction, and Clustering**
**Folder:** `ml-theory-pca-clustering-logistic`  
A hybrid project combining conceptual understanding with practical implementations.

- **Logistic Regression Theory**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering**

**Files Included:**
- `CS24MTECH14011_Assign4_5.ipynb`, `CS24MTECH14011_Assign4_6.ipynb`: Sequential notebooks covering all components.
- `assignment_4.pdf`, `Cs24MTECH14011_Assignn4.pdf`: Instructions and submission files.

### 4. **Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods**
**Folder:** `svm-kernel-methods`  
An in-depth exploration of SVMs with multiple kernel functions:

- Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels
- Margin visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning and decision boundaries

**Files Included:**
- `svm-kernel-methods.ipynb`: Implementation and experimentation.
- `svm-kernel-methods.pdf`: Exported notebook.
- `Assignment_2.pdf`: Problem statement.

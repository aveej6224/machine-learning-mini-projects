# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains a set of hands-on mini-projects exploring various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Each project is organized in its own folder with accompanying code notebooks and problem statements.

## Repository Structure

### 1. knn-dt-nb-models
Implements and compares three classification models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

Includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries.

**Contents:**
- knn-dt-nb-models.ipynb
- knn-dt-nb-models.pdf
- FOML_ASSIGNMENT1.pdf

### 2. logistic-kaggle-regression
Applies logistic regression to a loan approval prediction problem. The project mimics a Kaggle-style competition with train/test data and submission generation.

**Contents:**
- FOML_ASSIGN_3_CS24MTECH14011.ipynb
- loan_train.csv
- loan_test.csv
- assignment_3
- FOML_ASSIGNMENT_3.pdf

### 3. ml-theory-pca-clustering-logistic
Covers:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical methods
- Logistic Regression theory and implementation

**Contents:**
